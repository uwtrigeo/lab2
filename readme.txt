I created two web maps as follows 

The first one 'index', followed the instructions, except I removed 'target=_blank' as it was breaking the links to the USGS earthquakes page. I also added a popup on the fault line layer. Below the map on the 'index' page I added a button to the second page 'index2' and below the description, about earthquakes and fault lines I added an iframe with the google map from lab 1.

The second map, 'index2', is a little different from the first in that it includes a drop-down in the top right where one of five basemaps can be selected and the two layers can be toggleed on/off. The second map also includes a button with a link to the first map, 'index'.

And on both maps I have added 5 different basemap options. On the first map this would need to be changed in the html code to select a different basemap and in the second a different basemap can be selected from the dropdown.
